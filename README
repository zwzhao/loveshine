This is a funny application, which can be used for expressing your love to your girl friend or boy friend.

Overall, you need 12+1 TelosB nodes to for a shape of heart as follows:

         11             1 
                0
    10                       2

 9                               3
   
    8                        4
    
         7              5
         
                6
                
Then you need to install LoveShine to all the above nodes and LoveShineBase to the controller node (node 13).

To start the heart shining, just get the controller node powered and press the user button.

Then the nodes will be shining with blue and red leds as shown in the picture final.jpg.
